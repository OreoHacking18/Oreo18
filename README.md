## SmartTravel

### App Description
//This app allows all travellers to see each other's live location (locations only available to participants). This feature helps travellers not get lost. This also allows users to split the bill more easily at the end of the meal. Imagine everyone has to hand out their credits card seperately, that’s a lot of work !!! Instead one person pays for all and then that person can click a button to make a request money from everyone else. This app also allows participants to share their pictures privately so that they can save their best memories.

### App Idea Evaluation
- Mobile: Mobile is essential for the instant logging of all travellers.
- Story: Users will be able to travel smart with the use of this app by allowing themselves to interact with their fellow travellers more smartly. Also users can split and pay bills seamlessly just via app.
- Market: Anyone can use this app. But app users must have an account.
- Habit: This is an app that everyone who are travelling in a group, either with families or strangers, can take advantage of. 
- Scope: This app is helpful for everyone and for all kinds of hangouts such as vacation trips, dinners and so on.
